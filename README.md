# Face Mask Detection with Machine Learning

## Overview

This project implements a face mask detection system using machine learning. The system can identify whether a person is wearing a face mask or not in real-time through image processing and deep learning techniques. This can be used in public spaces to ensure compliance with mask-wearing regulations during health crises like COVID-19.

## Features

- Real-time face detection using a webcam or uploaded images.
- Classification of detected faces into two categories: **With Mask** and **Without Mask**.
- High accuracy and speed due to the use of pre-trained deep learning models.
- Easy integration into various systems, such as security cameras or monitoring systems.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-mask-detection.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd face-mask-detection
    ```
3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash

    ```
4. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of two classes:

1. **With Mask**: Images of people wearing masks.
2. **Without Mask**: Images of people without masks.
